                Do I need my own headset?
            </b></p>
        
                <p>
                    No, Ready Player Fun includes a top of the line VR headset for use throughout your stay at the park. 
                </p>
            <p><b>
                Can I bring my own VR headset?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                   No, the headsets used at the park have already been synced and calibrated to our attractions. Additionally headsets without certain features would be incompatible with the physical apparati for the game.
                </p>
            <p><b>
                What benefits are there to the park opposed to HomePlay?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    While HomePlay offers a lot in the way of convenience and accessibility, it cannot replicate the additional technology used at the park. VR treadmills allow for full body engagement as does body tracking for our laser tag and water based attractions. Our technology allows whole body engagement in VR, while humidity and temperature controls, full surround sound and other environmental controls will ensure it's a fully immersive experience.
                </p>
            <p><b>
                How can I play from home?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Simply use our website to purchase the desired attraction. You will then be able to download the attraction and will receive an access code. This code will provide you with access to the game for the time selected at checkout. Once playing, you’ll be able to join other HomePlay users in any multiplayer experiences and climb up the leaderboards!

            <p><b>
                I am physically impaired, can I attend the park?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Absolutely, all areas of the park are wheelchair and scooter accessible. Furthermore, all rides, with the exception of Laser Tag, can be adapted to be played with arm and head movements only. Some features, such as the simulated falls in rock climbing will not be available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those with hearing impairments, all attractions have closed captioning available and a new, directional audio that displays the direction and approximate distance of sounds. This allows for proper orientation when looking for enemies or events happening off screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to the nature of Virtual Reality headsets, those with visual impairments may not be able to fully enjoy the park. Please contact our customer service and we would be happy to help decide what attractions and features of the park you can enjoy and to help plan your trip to fully optimize your experience.   
                </p>
            <p><b>
                Is there anyone else who shouldn’t use the park?  
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Visitors who are pregnant, suffer from severe motion sickness or epilepsy, or have a pre-existing injury, are recommended to seek the advice of a medical professional before entering the park. All patrons are required to sign a consent form that releases the park from liability to any injury that occurs within normal park function. 
                </p>
            <p><b>
                Can I bring my baby?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Absolutely, Ready Player Fun is a family oriented facility. Because of the disorienting nature of VR, babies cannot participate in any attraction, but as long as they are supervised at all times are always welcome in our park free of charge. Please note that there must be a person 14 or older with the baby at all times, with neither engaging in a VR attraction, to ensure the safety of the baby.

                Can I injure myself playing the games?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    While possible, injury is very unlikely. Certain games with simulated environments include drops or falls, but are very small and have the necessary padding to meet OSHA safety requirements. These features, as well as their severity, can be controlled by the attendant. We ask that anyone with pre-existing injuries or past injuries convey these to the attendant to ensure that the experience is as safe as possible.

                What happens if I get hurt?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    In the unlikely event of an injury, our first aid trained staff will be there to assist you. With a fully stocked first aid facility by our main customber service desk, and a trained first aid technician on site at all times, you'll be in great hands.
                </p>
            <p><b>
                Is VR safe?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Yes, VR is incredibly safe. The only side effect that is occasionally reported is some motion sickness. Often more tolerable than the nausea experienced at rollercoaster and extreme ride theme parks, we simply recommend a break from further VR attractions until the feeling subsides.
                </p>
            <p><b>
                Is the park regularly cleaned?    
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Yes, the park is fully disinfeted before each open period throughout the day and common contact points are regularly disinfected by our staff throughout the day.

                <p>
                    Ready Player Fun has washrooms throughout the park, all equipped with baby changing stations and accessible by wheelchair. Lockers are located throughout the facility so you can bring your belongings and keep them safe. 
                </p>
            <p><b>
                What is there to eat at the park?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    In our food court you'll find 12 different foodstands serving a plethora of different types of food. Classic pub fare, Indian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Italian, Mexican and Ukranian are just some of the options. Mini Donuts and other sweets are also located thoughout the park. 
                </p>
            <p><b>
                I have food allergies, can I still eat at the park?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Yes! While our desert stands cannot guarantee that a product is peanut free, most other food services are certified peanut free and have options for those with lactose or gluten sensitivity. 
                </p>
            <p><b>
                I am a vegan, will there be options at the park that I can eat?
            </b></p>
                <p>
                    Of course. While many of our food options contain meat, we have worked hard to conciously maintain vegan freindly options as well. We also can accomodate religious diets and serve Halal products upon request.
