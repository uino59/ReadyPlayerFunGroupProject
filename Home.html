            <p>
                As we navigate these turbulent times, we are taking further precautions in doing our part to stop the
                spread of COVID-19. We have reduced all prices of attractions for HomePlay, meaning for a fraction of
                the price you can stay home and still enjoy our attractions with use of your own VR headset. With the
                purchase of 5 or more attractions, you will receive credit towards a ticket, applicable upon the park’s
                return to regular function.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those without headsets, or who would like to enjoy the full features of the park, Ready Player Fun
                will be running at half capacity to ensure social distancing can be properly implemented and maintained.
                As such, tickets will be valid from 9am-2:30pm or 3:30pm-9pm. In the time between openings, the park
                will be fully sanitized.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be supplying a Ready Player Fun branded face mask with every ticket purchase. Children under 3
                years, who enter for free, will need a facemask. One can be brought from home or purchased at the
                ticket booth for $5.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ready Player Fun uses cashless procedures for all purchases. We accept credit and debit and recommend
                the use of contactless payment when possible. Cash will not be accepted at this time in order to reduce
                contact.
            </p>
            <p>
                As per National Health recommendations, please only travel to the Ready Play Fun in small groups,
                with your family/household unit, and keep within your social bubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the safety of all of our guests and team members, outside food and beverages will not be permitted
                on site. In an effort to decrease touch points we ask that you do not bring outside food, beverages,
                bags, backpacks and coolers. There will not be lockers or storage spaces available at this time.

                            Enjoy one of the most dynamic and fast paced games of laser tag out there. In what is the
                            largest area of any of Ready Player Fun’s attractions, you’ll be pitted team against
                            another team in a fierce battle of augmented reality laser tag. Including game modes
                            ranging from President to Team Tasematch to Capture the Flag, you and your team will use a
                            variety of different weapons in a fully simulated environment that can be destroyed and
                            manipulated throughout the match. Use of bird’s eye scanning allows full tracking of
                            players with no desyncing to prevent collisions. Most likely the best game of Laser Tag
                            you’ve ever played.
